Getting to hear people’s stories of life, love and resilience makes our role very fulfilling.</p>
            <p>We value working with funeral directors and support teams to minimise the family’s stress beforehand and on the day of the funeral; we are also comfortable working in any space. Our aim is to listen well to understand what ‘meaningful’ and ‘personal’ mean for every family and help make that happen, to the best of our ability.</p>

                <p>A eulogy is a speech or piece of writing that pays tribute to someone who has passed away. It is typically delivered during a funeral or memorial service and serves to honour the life, character, and legacy of the deceased. A eulogy can be delivered by a family member, close friend, or a celebrant, and it offers an opportunity to share memories, express gratitude, and celebrate the unique qualities that made the person special.</p>
                <p><strong>How to write a eulogy:</strong> Start by gathering memories from family and friends. Write in a conversational tone, as if speaking directly to the person. Structure your eulogy with an introduction, main body (key stories and qualities), and a closing. Keep it between 3–7 minutes when spoken. Practice reading it aloud to check the flow and emotional tone. It is okay to show emotion—those present will understand. Our celebrants can help you refine and deliver your eulogy with confidence.</p>
                <p><strong>What to include in a eulogy:</strong> Include the person's full name and relationship to you. Share their life story—birthplace, family, career, passions. Highlight their character traits, values, and the impact they had on others. Include 1–3 memorable stories or anecdotes that capture their spirit. Mention their achievements, hobbies, and what they loved. End with a message of farewell, gratitude, or hope. Avoid overly negative topics; focus on celebrating their life.</p>

                <p>Poetry can add depth and beauty to a funeral or memorial service. Classic choices include "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night" by Dylan Thomas, "Remember" by Christina Rossetti, or "Funeral Blues" by W.H. Auden. Contemporary poets like Mary Oliver and David Whyte also offer moving pieces. Choose a poem that reflects the personality of your loved one or the tone you wish to set. Our celebrants can suggest readings tailored to your ceremony.</p>

                <p>Scripture readings can provide comfort and spiritual reflection during a funeral or memorial. Popular choices include Psalm 23 ("The Lord is my shepherd"), Ecclesiastes 3:1–8 ("A time for everything"), John 14:1–6 ("Do not let your hearts be troubled"), and Revelation 21:1–4 (a new heaven and earth). We work with families of all faiths to incorporate meaningful religious texts into ceremonies in a way that honours both tradition and the individual.</p>

In particular, we all thought you did an excellent job of alluding to some of the more complex aspects of Dad's character, which had to be alluded to in order to build an honest picture of his life. We all got a laugh from the music as well, which was a welcome relief! Thanks again."</p>

            <p>"Just wanted to say a heartfelt thank you for the way you conducted Mum's service. You made it very warm and respectful and the research you had done beforehand gave it a very personal touch. Many people commented to us about how good you were. Thanks for allowing the service to start late after waiting for Rita's sister to arrive, and for accommodating the two unexpected speakers. You made a difficult time that much easier. Thank you again, and all the best."</p>

            <p>"Thank you for a beautiful service for mum today. As with my grandmother's service, your genuine and caring nature made today a very special memory for us all, and I thank you deeply for that. Several people who I spoke to after the service asked how long we'd known you, assuming it was a long period – you spoke of mum with such fondness and knowledge. You have a special gift, and it was a great comfort to us as we planned mum's funeral, knowing how pleased she had been with her own mum's. Thank you again."</p>

            <p>"I would like to say, on behalf of my family, a very big thankyou for the wonderful service you held last Friday for Dad. It could not have been better and I know, for a fact, that it was exactly as Dad would have wanted it - not drawn out, a time for seriousness, a time to laugh and a time to cry and with everyone having their chance to say what they wanted to."</p>

            <p>"On behalf of my family I would like to thank you again for Nan's lovely service. You eloquently captured what she was like from our conversation about her. You gave her dignity back when a lot of it was taken away because of her age and frailty. I'm sure she was looking down pleased with her send off!"</p>

            <p>"I just wanted to say a big thank you for being the minister at my mum's funeral that was held on Monday 16th of April. It was beautifully done and your choice of words and kind words about mum were great. Also wanted to say thank you for the poem by David Harkins that you read and also the short poem "after glow"; they were very touching."</p>

            <p>"My family and I would like to thank you sincerely for your support and your sensitivity in the planning and ceremonial delivery of the funeral for our Grandson. Your sensitive and empathetic handling of the sad and tragic demise of our Grandson did not go unnoticed or appreciated and will be remembered always. I am sure your work as celebrant minister is appreciated by all those who have been fortunate enough to have you assist and officiate at difficult times for them. We found your approach and demeanour to be respectful at all times. We thank you for this and know that your work will benefit others as it has benefitted us."</p>
